# Operational rename, slice 1 (chronicle#143, mechanism 3)

Lane C5's handoff notes previously lived here; its durable record is
`LANE_C5_REPORT.md`. This file now tracks the active lane on this branch.

## State

- Branch: `ops-rename-slice1`, cut from `origin/main` at `ff3efd3`.
- Scope: env names, R2 bucket configurability, `ledger.db` -> `chronicle.db`,
  and the docs for all three. Code and docs only; no infrastructure changes.
- Out of scope and deliberately untouched: the `ledger` console-script alias,
  the Supabase `"ledger"` schema and mirror table names, governance role ids and
  concept authorities, hash domains and schema ids, anything under `releases/`.

## Done

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/storage-architecture.md`,
  `docs/agent-source-package-harness.md`, and the mechanism-3 migration spec in
  the first comment of PolicyEngine/chronicle#143.
- Enumerated every ledger-named env read in tracked Python: the four real
  variables (`LEDGER_SOURCE_ARTIFACT_CACHE_DIR`, `LEDGER_SOURCE_ARTIFACT_FETCH`,
  `LEDGER_PE_US_DATA_ROOT`, `LEDGER_PE_UK_DATA_ROOT`) plus
  `POLICYENGINE_LEDGER_SCHEMA`. `LEDGER_MIRROR_TABLES`,
  `LEDGER_MIRROR_PRIMARY_KEYS`, and `LEDGER_DB_SCHEMA_VERSION` are module
  constants, not env reads, and name out-of-scope surfaces.
- Added `chronicle/env.py`: one shared `env_value`/`env_flag`/`env_names`
  helper reading `CHRONICLE_<X>` first, then `LEDGER_<X>` and
  `POLICYENGINE_LEDGER_<X>` with a once-per-process
  `ChronicleEnvDeprecationWarning` naming the preferred variable.
- Replaced all three ad-hoc helpers (`db/supabase_client._env`,
  `chronicle/source_package._env_value`/`_truthy_env`,
  `db/pe_source_inventory._env_value`) with the shared helper.

## Next

- Make R2 bucket names configurable with unchanged `ledger-*` defaults.
- Emit `chronicle.db` for new suite outputs; keep reading `ledger.db`.
- Fix the backwards fallback statement in the docs and sweep every env-name,
  bucket-name, and db-filename mention in README/AGENTS/docs.
- Add the hermetic dual-read tests; run pytest, ruff check, ruff format --check.
- Push and open the PR. Do not merge.
