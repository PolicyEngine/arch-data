# PR #227 Astra gate round 3

## State

- Detached lane rebased from `28647088` onto `origin/ops-rename-slice1`
  (`ba8147a7`). Integration and the full baseline pass on code commit `426651e`.
  The four finding regressions are next.
- Evidence report: `/tmp/chronicle-227-fix/out.md`.
- Prior PR #227 journal preserved beside the report as `pr227-prior-progress.md`.
  The #226 journal below is retained verbatim.

## Done

- Replayed the PR #227 commits onto the new base without branches, stash, push,
  or GitHub network. Reconciled final module versions against both branch heads.
- Restored shared vintage validation, nonregular manifest refusals, canonical
  identities, exact resource spelling, environment aliases, and both test sets.

- Rebase integration checks passed: 537 artifact/peer/registration/package tests,
  27 source-path tests, and 160 consumer/env/kind/vintage tests. Ruff passes.
- Rebased the exact kindless freeze onto `ba8147a7` (168 publisher manifests),
  without editing data files. Both public staged releases and shared table-file
  revisions retain their distinct storage behavior.

- Read-only rebase scope audit passed: all 1,130 inherited test functions,
  protected files, 22 timestamp proofs, and 15 UK microdata pins are preserved.
- Source audit found a possible scalar-entry error-handling regression from
  integration. Reproduction and any correction are deferred until the baseline
  has completed, keeping the tested code fixed throughout that run.

- Required post-rebase full baseline completed before touching the findings:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider`
  exited 0 with **1,587 passed, 7 skipped, 42 warnings** in **1,430.28 seconds**
  (23:50). Log: `/tmp/chronicle-227-fix/baseline-full.log`.

- Reproduced the rebase scalar-entry concern: six cases fail with uncaught
  `AttributeError` before the complete-manifest refusal. Red test committed
  before the integration correction; evidence is in `source-entry-red.log`.

- Finding 1 reproduced red with and without upload: fetch attempted to write
  the 2023 table and manifest over the 2022 filename. Both cases failed the
  no-write assertion (`finding1-red.log`); fix not yet applied.

- Finding 3 reproduced red in automatic and explicit commit modes: an unrelated
  repository with matching consumer blobs emitted Microcosm provenance. Both
  variants incorrectly returned success (`finding3-red.log`).

- Finding 2 reproduced red: four archived filename/digest variants reached a
  filesystem mutation; four corresponding package-validation cases accepted
  the conflict. Eight failures recorded in `finding2-red.log`.

## Next

- Reproduce and resolve the source-entry integration concern.
- Reproduce each finding before fixing it, then run the final required gates.

# Operational rename, slice 1 (chronicle#143, mechanism 3)

Lane C5's handoff notes previously lived here; its durable record is
`LANE_C5_REPORT.md`. This file now tracks the active lane on this branch.

## State

- Branch: `ops-rename-slice1`, cut from `origin/main` at `ff3efd3`.
- Scope: env names, R2 bucket configurability, `ledger.db` -> `chronicle.db`,
  and the docs for all three. Code and docs only; no infrastructure changes.
- Out of scope and deliberately untouched: the `ledger` console-script alias,
  the Supabase `"ledger"` schema and mirror table names, governance role ids and
  concept authorities, hash domains and schema ids, anything under `releases/`.
- This PR does not touch the source-data boundary. No package spec, parser,
  selector, manifest, or fact value changes.

## Done

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/storage-architecture.md`,
  `docs/agent-source-package-harness.md`, and the mechanism-3 migration spec in
  the first comment of PolicyEngine/chronicle#143.
- Enumerated every ledger-named env read in tracked Python: the four real
  variables (`LEDGER_SOURCE_ARTIFACT_CACHE_DIR`, `LEDGER_SOURCE_ARTIFACT_FETCH`,
  `LEDGER_PE_US_DATA_ROOT`, `LEDGER_PE_UK_DATA_ROOT`) plus
  `POLICYENGINE_LEDGER_SCHEMA`. `LEDGER_MIRROR_TABLES`,
  `LEDGER_MIRROR_PRIMARY_KEYS`, and `LEDGER_DB_SCHEMA_VERSION` are module
  constants, not env reads, and name out-of-scope surfaces.
- Added `chronicle/env.py`: one shared `env_value`/`env_flag`/`env_names`
  helper reading `CHRONICLE_<X>` first, then `POLICYENGINE_LEDGER_<X>` and
  `LEDGER_<X>` with a once-per-process `ChronicleEnvDeprecationWarning` naming
  the preferred variable.
- Replaced all three ad-hoc helpers (`db/supabase_client._env`,
  `chronicle/source_package._env_value`/`_truthy_env`,
  `db/pe_source_inventory._env_value`) with the shared helper.
- Made the R2 bucket names configurable via `CHRONICLE_R2_RAW_BUCKET` and
  `CHRONICLE_R2_DERIVED_BUCKET`, plumbed through fetch-artifact, publish-raw,
  publish-derived and bootstrap-r2. Defaults unchanged at `ledger-raw` and
  `ledger-derived`. Both manifest write paths now preserve a recorded
  `storage.r2` block instead of restating it under a renamed bucket.
- Emitted `chronicle.db` for new suite outputs, with `ledger.db` still accepted
  on read and on derived-artifact kind inference.
- Added `tests/test_chronicle_env.py` plus artifact tests: 75 hermetic tests
  covering the lookup ladder, precedence, the once-per-process warning, and every
  real call site.
- Swept the docs. `docs/storage-architecture.md` gained an "Environment Variable
  Rename Window" section (the old text stated the fallback direction backwards)
  and a "Bucket Cutover" section; `docs/agent-source-package-harness.md` and
  `README.md` follow. Verified 186 distinct `ledger-raw` objects across 154
  tracked manifest files, every key content-addressed by sha256.

## Review fixes (gate round 1)

The Fable+Sol gate requested changes; both findings are applied on this branch.

- **[high] `fetch-artifact` could attach a recorded R2 URI to new bytes.** The
  preserve rule keyed on the bucket, so a repeated fetch that did not re-upload
  into the same bucket kept the recorded `storage.r2` block while rewriting the
  entry's `sha256`/`size_bytes`. Reproduced against this branch's parent by
  serving two different bodies from one URL: the entry ends up declaring the
  fetched bytes' `sha256` under a key addressed by the superseded bytes' one,
  both when the fetch only registers the bytes and when the bucket default has
  moved.
  The rule now keys on identity — the recorded key's `{sha256}/{filename}` tail
  against the fetched bytes. Identical preserves the block exactly; different
  raises `SourceArtifactRevisionError` before the cached artifact or its
  manifest entry is touched, naming recorded and fetched `sha256`/`size_bytes`
  and the ADR rule that same vintage plus new bytes is a new release revision.
  `--record-revision` opts in: the new bytes get their own content-addressed key
  under the configured bucket, never the old key, and the superseded block moves
  to `storage.previous_r2`. `publish-raw` applies the same check before treating
  a recorded block as history (`recorded_r2_identity_mismatch`, nothing
  uploaded).
- **[low] Env isolation was scoped to one module.** The autouse fixture moved to
  `tests/conftest.py` and now clears all three prefixes for every test.
  `db.supabase_client` resolves `LEDGER_SCHEMA` at import — during collection,
  before any fixture — so `tests/test_chronicle_namespace.py` re-imports it
  under the cleared environment instead of asserting the constant it bound at
  collection time.

`storage.previous_r2` is a sibling key, chosen because every reader
(`inventory-artifacts`, `publish-raw`, `source_package._artifact_content`, the
suite's raw-R2-link acceptance check) reads `storage.r2` alone, and
`publish-raw` already spreads the rest of the `storage` block when it writes
back, so a revision survives publication untouched. All 180 tracked manifest
entries that carry a `storage.r2` block are content-addressed and agree with
their declared `sha256` and `filename`, so the identity check never fires on
tracked data.

## Review fixes (gate round 2)

The second Fable+Sol gate requested changes again. Seven findings, each fixed
with a regression test on this branch. Plan, in dependency order:

1. **[high] `CHRONICLE_SCHEMA` does not reach the Supabase mirror writer.**
   `chronicle/harness.py` and `chronicle/mirror.py` default the schema to the
   literal `"ledger"`; only `db.supabase_client` reads the renamed variable.
   Resolve through the shared helper whenever no explicit `--schema` is given.
2. **[high] The derived-fact boundary check is not rename-safe.**
   `chronicle/consumer_contract.py` matches the `.ledger_derived` suffix only.
3. **[high] `fetch-artifact` cannot address a package's non-default manifest.**
   Seven tracked packages keep a `manifest_*_source_package.yaml`; three
   directories keep two. A fetch into one of them writes a third manifest and
   never sees the recorded block.
4. **[high] Revision protection vanishes when the entry has no `storage.r2`.**
5. **[medium] Recorded-R2 locator fields must be cross-checked**, not read as
   key-or-URI, before a block is preserved or published.
6. **[medium] `_read_manifest` must reject a malformed document**, not treat a
   non-mapping YAML payload as an absent manifest.
7. **[low] Schema resolution must be lazy** so no legacy variable is read at
   collection, before the autouse isolation fixture runs.

## State (round 2)

- Read both gate rounds on PolicyEngine/chronicle#226 and the code each finding
  names.
- Scanned all 154 tracked manifest files (187 `files` entries, every one
  carrying `storage.r2`): every recorded block supplies provider, bucket, key
  and uri; every key is content-addressed; every declared `sha256`/`filename`
  agrees with its key tail; no `uri` contradicts its `key`. Strict locator
  validation therefore refuses nothing that is tracked today.
- All seven findings are applied, each with a regression test, and each
  reproduced against this branch's previous head (`34d1d0f`) first.

### What each fix does

1. `chronicle/env.py` gains `default_chronicle_schema()`: one home for the
   `CHRONICLE_SCHEMA` -> `POLICYENGINE_LEDGER_SCHEMA` -> `LEDGER_SCHEMA` ->
   `"ledger"` ladder. `load_supabase_mirror`, its harness wrapper and the
   `--schema` CLI default all resolve through it when no schema is supplied;
   an explicit `--schema` still wins. Defaults unchanged.
2. `chronicle/consumer_contract.py` matches the whole final dot-segment of a
   `source_record_id` against both `ledger_derived` and `chronicle_derived`.
3. `fetch-artifact --manifest <filename>` selects which of a package's
   manifests the entry belongs to (default `manifest.yaml`); the name must be
   a filename inside `--out-dir`.
4. Revision protection now compares against the entry's recorded identity --
   the recorded key's `{sha256}/{filename}` once published, the declared
   `sha256` before that -- so a registered-but-unpublished entry, or one whose
   upload failed, is protected exactly like a published one.
5. `_validated_recorded_r2` cross-checks every supplied locator field against
   every other and against the content-addressed key shape. A contradiction is
   `RecordedR2LocatorError` at fetch time and `recorded_r2_locator_invalid` at
   publish time, never a preserved block.
6. `_read_manifest` refuses a non-mapping or unparseable document
   (`MalformedManifestError`) before the publisher is read at all;
   `inventory-artifacts` and `publish-raw` report it instead of crashing.
7. `db.supabase_client` resolves both schemas per call rather than at import,
   and `tests/conftest.py` strips the rename window in `pytest_configure`, so
   no module can read or warn from an operator's shell during collection.

All four refusals share a `SourceArtifactManifestError` base, so the
`fetch-artifact` CLI reports every one as exit 1 with nothing written.

### Reproduced against `34d1d0f` (the round-1 head)

Running the same operations against a checkout of the previous head:

1. `load_supabase_mirror` default `schema='ledger'`; with
   `CHRONICLE_SCHEMA=chronicle_probe` the load still reports `schema='ledger'`.
2. `'.chronicle_derived'.endswith('.ledger_derived')` is False: the boundary
   never fired for the chronicle spelling.
3. `fetch_source_artifact()` rejects `manifest_filename` as an unexpected
   keyword; a fetch into `ira_contributions/` writes `manifest.yaml`.
4. A fetch of different bytes over a registered (unpublished) entry was
   accepted silently: the entry's `sha256` was rewritten with no refusal.
5. A block whose `key` and `uri` named different objects was preserved
   verbatim, key sha `c63744a4...` beside uri sha `1e9b3fdb...`.
6. A list-valued `manifest.yaml` was overwritten by the fetch.
7. Importing `db.supabase_client` under `LEDGER_SCHEMA=zzz` bound
   `LEDGER_SCHEMA='zzz'` and emitted a `FutureWarning` at collection.

## Verification

- `uv run pytest -q`: green.
- `uv run ruff check .`: clean.
- `uv run ruff format --check .`: clean for every file this branch touches. 13
  files are unformatted on `main` already and are byte-identical here; CI runs
  `ruff check` only, so they are pre-existing and out of scope.
- CI's db CLI gate (`chronicle init` / `load all` / `stats`): passes.
- `CHRONICLE_R2_RAW_BUCKET=zzz CHRONICLE_SCHEMA=zzz uv run pytest -q`: green.
  Before the shared fixture it failed five tests — four bucket-default
  assertions in `tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py` and the collection-time
  schema constant in `tests/test_chronicle_namespace.py`.

## Next

- Push and open the PR against `main`. Do not merge.
- Follow-up PR, after Max creates and backfills the new buckets: flip
  `DEFAULT_R2_RAW_BUCKET` / `DEFAULT_R2_DERIVED_BUCKET` to `chronicle-raw` /
  `chronicle-derived`.

## Review fixes (Sol gate round 3)

### State

- Detached HEAD: `fb1bc1df`, the PR #226 head supplied for the ten-finding Sol
  gate round.
- Scope: ten operational-rename findings in artifact fetch/publish/inventory,
  Supabase compatibility aliases, and the README cutover procedure. No tracked
  `db/data/**` manifest will be changed.
- `CLAUDE.md`, one of the requested initial reads, is absent from both this
  worktree and `/Users/maxghenis/PolicyEngine/chronicle`; `AGENTS.md` and the
  remaining requested guidance/code/tests are present.
- PR #227 is available read-only at
  `/Users/maxghenis/PolicyEngine/_worktrees/chronicle-227-fix`. Applicable
  non-microdata hunks from `daafac0` and `c0d9d74` will be ported with the same
  function names and shapes.

### Done

- Re-established the lane state in this committed progress log before making
  gate-round code or test changes.
- Read `AGENTS.md`, the Bucket Cutover and Publisher Revisions contracts in
  `docs/storage-architecture.md`, the README cutover instructions, and the
  named implementation/test surfaces. Confirmed Chronicle must preserve
  publisher bytes and provenance, refuse unsafe fetches before I/O, and leave
  schema/bucket value cutovers explicit.
- Reproduced findings 1, 4, 5, and 8 with 11 failing cases: mismatched manifest
  identity reached the publisher read, quoted year keys bypassed revision
  protection, duplicate year spellings and malformed entries reached I/O, and
  both refetch and revision discarded entry metadata.
- Ported the non-microdata parts of #227's `_assert_manifest_identifies`,
  `_select_vintage_entry`, `_FETCH_OWNED_FIELDS`, and in-place
  `_upsert_manifest` flow. Fetch now validates manifest identity and entry
  shape before I/O, resolves either year-key spelling while refusing both,
  preserves the recorded key spelling, and carries forward every field it does
  not own. The 11 focused cases now pass.
- Reproduced finding 2 with both default sweeps reporting only one of four
  supported manifest names, and finding 7 with all four falsy non-mapping
  `files` values producing `(inventory.valid, publish.valid) == (True, True)`.
- Ported #227's `is_manifest_filename` / `package_manifest_paths` shapes and
  made default root sweeps discover `manifest.yaml`, `manifest.yml`, and both
  `manifest_<package>` extensions. Both sweeps now share `_manifest_files`, so
  only `None` means absent and every other non-mapping value is reported. All
  106 artifact tests pass.
- Reproduced finding 3 as a green preserved-bucket skip for a key routed to the
  wrong package/year, and finding 6 as both a fetch reaching I/O and a green
  publish skip for a self-consistent `s3://` block under `storage.r2`.
- Raw publish now compares the recorded key with the canonical
  source/package/year key before any bucket-change skip. Recorded R2 validation
  also requires `provider='r2'` (and therefore an `r2://` effective URI). The
  focused canonical-key/provider tests, including the existing URI-only and
  stale-country cases, pass without uploads or manifest rewrites on refusal.
- Reproduced finding 9 with the shipped import raising `ImportError` for
  `LEDGER_SCHEMA`, then restored `LEDGER_SCHEMA` and `TARGETS_SCHEMA` as
  deprecated aliases of the stable defaults. Runtime queries remain on the
  lazy functions and still honor post-import environment changes; 55 focused
  namespace/env/client cases pass (1 skipped for absent real credentials).
- Reproduced both parts of finding 10: the README did not state that an
  unqualified mirror load writes to `ledger`, and it named the absent
  `supabase/migrations/20260504_chronicle_bronze.sql` file.
- README now instructs operators to create and apply the deployment migration,
  states the `ledger` runtime default, and gives both supported ways to target
  `chronicle`. The storage architecture and source-package harness use the same
  truthful procedure; no documentation names the absent SQL file. Both README
  regression tests pass.
- Adversarial review tightened the same contracts before final verification.
  Mixed-case package manifests were reproduced as omissions from both root
  sweeps and from the stray-default guard; default discovery now filters every
  recursive filename through the case-insensitive #227 helper. Missing
  `provider` and missing `uri` locators were each reproduced reaching publisher
  I/O; `storage.r2` now requires explicit `provider: r2` and an `r2://` URI.
  The artifact file's 112 tests pass.
- Clarified that *all* schema environment overrides, including deprecated
  spellings, precede the `ledger` default. The README test now also requires
  the create/apply-migration instruction, so deleting the guidance cannot pass
  vacuously. All 14 mirror tests pass.
- Completed the remaining non-microdata preflight port from #227. Reproduced
  four invalid explicit/inferred artifact filenames reaching `_read_artifact`,
  including `filename=manifest.yaml`, which could overwrite the selected
  manifest, and reproduced an undiscoverable `custom.yaml` manifest reaching
  publisher I/O. Ported `is_bare_filename`, `bare_filename`,
  `_infer_artifact_filename` from `daafac0`, and the manifest-like artifact
  refusal plus discoverable `_manifest_path` restriction from `c0d9d74`. All
  117 artifact tests pass after the pre-I/O fix.

### Next

- None in this lane. All ten Sol findings, the non-microdata #227 port
  completeness pass, and adversarial follow-ups are committed and verified.
  The final evidence and per-finding commit map are in the runner's external
  `-o out.md` report, not a repository-root file.

### Final verification

- `uv run ruff check .`: exit 0 (`All checks passed!`).
- `uv run ruff format --check` on all six changed Python files: exit 0
  (`6 files already formatted`).
- Full `uv run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider`: direct exit 0, 995 passed,
  1 skipped, 18 warnings in 1539.05 seconds.
- A fresh `/tmp` copy of tracked USDA `fy69_to_current` reports two manifests
  and two artifacts in inventory. Publish includes both: FY2024 is one safe
  preserved-bucket skip and the known misrouted FY2025 package/year key is one
  explicit failure, with zero uploads. No tracked manifest was changed.
- The external `-o out.md` report records every failing-first command and
  observation, regression test, fix commit, and exact #227 port provenance.

## Review fixes (Sol gate round 2, eight findings)

### State

- Detached HEAD began at `c36f3fc8`, the supplied head of PR #226; base is
  `main` at `9da02431`. The worktree was clean at intake.
- Scope is the eight supplied findings: cutover compatibility, shared-file
  revision ownership, artifact/manifest path safety, duplicate YAML keys,
  malformed revision history, and import-time Supabase alias compatibility.
- No tracked `db/data/**` manifest will be modified. The whole-tree cutover
  regression will operate on a temporary copy and use a non-writing uploader.
- PR #227 is available read-only at
  `/Users/maxghenis/PolicyEngine/_worktrees/chronicle-227-fix` at `5557cb9e`.
  Applicable non-microdata hunks will be ported with the same function names
  and shapes so its later rebase stays straightforward.

### Done

- Read the existing `PROGRESS.md`, the Bucket Cutover and Publisher Revisions
  sections of `docs/storage-architecture.md`, and all six requested code/test
  files: `chronicle/artifacts.py`, `chronicle/harness.py`,
  `chronicle/source_package.py`, `db/supabase_client.py`,
  `tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py`, and `tests/test_chronicle_env.py`.
- Read the GitNexus debugging/refactoring workflow guidance. No GitNexus MCP
  graph tools are exposed in this session, so dependency tracing will use
  repository search, focused tests, and the stacked PR's committed diffs.
- Confirmed the baseline gaps in the named code: `_read_manifest` still uses
  `yaml.safe_load`; `_root_manifest_paths` passes a non-default value to
  `rglob`; manifest-declared filenames reach direct path joins and reads;
  fetch updates only its selected manifest; `_superseding_storage` converts a
  non-list `previous_r2` to an empty history; and the Supabase compatibility
  constants are hard-coded defaults.
- **Finding 6 reproduced and fixed.** Red command:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p
  no:cacheprovider tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py::test_fetch_refuses_duplicate_manifest_keys_before_publisher_io`
  exited 1 with four failures; every duplicate (`source_id`, `package_id`,
  `files`, vintage) reached the publisher-read sentinel. Test-only commit:
  `56f9ce1`. Ported #227 commit `7f9bfe6`'s `StrictManifestLoader` and
  `load_manifest_document` verbatim into `chronicle/registration.py`, switched
  artifact manifest reads to it, and shared it with source-package artifact
  manifest reads. Fix commit: `77e6fda`. The same focused command now exits 0
  with 4 passed.
- **Findings 3, 4, and 5 reproduced and fixed.** Test-only commit: `264e46e`.
  The finding 4 command covering creation beside `manifest.yml`,
  `Manifest.yaml`, a mistyped named manifest, and a symlinked manifest exited
  1 with 4 failures, all reaching the publisher-I/O sentinel. The finding 5
  command covering parent traversal plus `*`, `?`, and character-class glob
  selectors exited 1 with 4 failures because none raised `ManifestNameError`.
  The finding 3 command covering absolute, parent-traversing, and symlinked
  artifact paths exited 1 with 3 failures because inventory considered each
  path valid (and the local, non-network publisher stub could read it).
- Artifact and manifest inputs are now resolved only as literal package-local
  directory entries: unsafe declared filenames return the named
  `non_canonical_filename` error, symlinks are refused before reads, sweep
  selectors cannot contain separators or glob syntax, and no new manifest
  spelling can be created beside an existing registry. Fix commit: `0017520`.
  Ported the #227-shaped `is_bare_filename`, `bare_filename`, `filename_key`,
  `matching_directory_entry`, and package-manifest helpers from `44e1f8d`,
  `7f9bfe6`, and `c2b7722`'s corresponding safety changes; the generalized
  registry-creation and exact sweep-selector guards are slice-1 additions.
  The focused post-fix command exits 0 with 13 passed, and the complete
  artifact module exits 0 with 132 passed.
- **Finding 2 reproduced and fixed.** Red command:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p
  no:cacheprovider tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py::test_shared_archive_revision_is_refused_through_an_unregistered_owner
  tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py::test_record_revision_updates_every_owner_of_usda_shared_archive
  tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py::test_record_revision_updates_every_same_manifest_owner`
  exited 1 with 3 failures: the empty selected vintage bypassed a sibling's
  recorded identity, the USDA second manifest retained its old checksum, and
  the SSA-style second key retained its old checksum. Test-only commit:
  `3636395`.
- Fetch now strictly loads every manifest in the package directory before
  publisher I/O, establishes one normalized byte identity for every entry
  naming the physical file, and applies the revision guard to all owners. An
  explicit revision rewrites every owner from payloads rendered before the
  first manifest write, preserves owner-specific metadata, and archives each
  owner's own R2 provenance. Ported #227's `_package_manifests` and
  `_assert_siblings_record_these_bytes` names/shapes from `c0d9d74`, including
  the normalized manifest-alias exclusion from `235c616`; the coordinated
  all-owner rewrite is slice-1-specific. Fix/docs commit: `7da26a9`. The red
  command now exits 0 with 3 passed; the artifact module exits 0 with 135
  passed.
- **Finding 1 reproduced and fixed.** The whole-tree regression copies tracked
  `db/data/**` to `tmp_path`, configures `CHRONICLE_R2_RAW_BUCKET=chronicle-raw`,
  and installs a successful non-writing uploader. Red command:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p
  no:cacheprovider tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py::test_documented_bucket_cutover_sweep_accepts_the_tracked_registry`
  exited 1 with the observed tuple `exit=1`, `valid=false`, 156 manifests, 187
  artifacts, 94 skipped, 93 failed, 94 R2-linked, zero uploaded, and five
  report errors. Test-only commit: `7f0f473`.
- A syntactically valid recorded R2 locator whose content-addressed tail
  matches the package-local checksum and filename is now preserved and skipped
  before reconstructing today's country/source/package/year route. This
  accepts 84 pre-country-prefix UK keys, eight explicit Statbel 2023 routes,
  the shared USDA route, and five fully recorded Eurostat manifests that omit
  package IDs, while locator contradictions and byte mismatches remain errors.
  Fix commit: `25deb29`; no #227 hunk applies. The same whole-tree command now
  exits 0 with 161 manifests, 194 artifacts, 194 skipped/R2-linked, zero
  uploaded or failed, and no errors. The artifact module exits 0 with 136
  passed.
- **Finding 7 reproduced and fixed.** Red command:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p
  no:cacheprovider tests/test_chronicle_artifacts.py::test_fetch_refuses_non_list_previous_r2_before_publisher_io`
  exited 1 with 3 failures: mapping, scalar, and null `previous_r2` values all
  reached the publisher-I/O sentinel. Test-only commit: `e418813`.
  `_validated_recorded_storage` now rejects every present non-list history
  before `_read_artifact`, so `_superseding_storage` cannot replace malformed
  provenance. Fix commit: `8b7ab22`; no #227 hunk applies. The focused command
  now exits 0 with 3 passed (5 passed including ordinary and shared revision
  history controls).
- **Finding 8 reproduced and fixed.** A fresh-process regression sets each of
  `CHRONICLE_SCHEMA`, `POLICYENGINE_LEDGER_SCHEMA`, and `LEDGER_SCHEMA` before
  importing the compatibility constants, alongside
  `POLICYENGINE_TARGETS_SCHEMA`. Red command:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p
  no:cacheprovider tests/test_chronicle_env.py::test_supabase_schema_compatibility_aliases_honor_import_time_environment`
  exited 1 with 3 failures; every subprocess returned `ledger` / `targets`.
  Test-only commit: `e2ceedf`.
- `LEDGER_SCHEMA` and `TARGETS_SCHEMA` are now import-time snapshots of the
  same lazy resolver functions runtime queries use, restoring their original
  environment-backed behavior while later environment mutations remain lazy
  through `chronicle_schema()` / `targets_schema()`. Fix commit: `f41ad0f`; no
  #227 hunk applies. The focused regression now exits 0 with 3 passed; it and
  the runtime/default namespace controls exit 0 with 11 passed.
- **Adversarial path-boundary follow-up reproduced and fixed.** Test-only
  commit `465a34c` showed normalized manifest aliases and a package-local
  artifact symlink reaching the publisher-read sentinel; invalid sweep names
  were accepted when the root was absent and escaped the CLI as tracebacks;
  manifest-named artifacts were not refused; and publish could upload a valid
  first entry before discovering an invalid later entry. The same audit also
  reproduced contradictory owners across sibling manifests being ignored by
  both sweeps.
- Fix commit `8e766ad` ports #227 commit `235c616`'s corrected
  `_package_manifests` normalized-alias guard, validates fetch destinations
  before publisher I/O, rejects manifest-named artifacts in publish and
  inventory, validates sweep selectors before checking the root, and reports
  those refusals cleanly from both CLIs. It also corrects the object-key docs
  to describe compatible recorded history. The six focused path/CLI cases now
  pass. Complete-package publish preflight and sibling-owner validation remain
  the next coherent fix.
- **Source-package reader follow-up reproduced and fixed.** Test-only commits
  `92af48c`, `9a51d99`, `3228238`, and `578c8b2` showed that a package spec
  could read an absolute or parent-traversing artifact, follow artifact and
  manifest symlinks, accept a normalized filename alias or manifest-named
  artifact, and select an unsafe/unsupported manifest path before artifact
  I/O. `SourceArtifactSpec` now resolves both manifest and artifact resources
  through the shared #227 filename-identity helpers before opening either.
  The ten focused cases pass, and the full source-package module passes with
  135 tests (13 warnings). Fix/journal commit: `64fe94b`.
- **Residual side-effect ordering reproduced.** The focused command covering
  `test_fetch_refuses_invalid_r2_identity_before_publisher_io` and
  `test_publish_preflights_entire_root_before_any_upload` exited 1 with three
  failures. Both slash-only R2 identity fields reached the publisher-read
  sentinel; a root sweep uploaded and rewrote the valid `a_good` package before
  reporting the unsafe filename in `z_bad`.
- Fetch now validates the source/package object-key components before reading
  publisher bytes. Raw publish now completes one root-wide read/identity/entry
  preflight and returns every refusal before its first uploader call or
  manifest rewrite. The three red cases plus the existing entry-, sibling-,
  and tracked-cutover preflight controls pass (9 tests). Fix commit:
  `4991e8f`. The complete artifact module passes with 154 tests (12 warnings).

### Next

None. The eight findings, required #227 ports, adversarial preflight follow-ups,
and final verification are complete. The external `-o out.md` report contains
the per-finding reproduction/fix/test/commit/port map.

### Final verification (eight-finding round)

- The first bare `uv run` lint invocations exited 2 before Ruff started because
  the sandbox denied access to `/Users/maxghenis/.cache/uv`. Re-running through
  the permitted existing cache (`UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache`) gave:
  `uv run ruff check .` exit 0 (`All checks passed!`) and `uv run ruff format
  --check` on the eight changed Python files exit 0 (`8 files already
  formatted`).
- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider`:
  direct exit 0, 1,039 passed, 7 skipped, 18 warnings in 1,323.73 seconds.
- Focused artifact module: direct exit 0, 154 passed, 12 warnings in 7.15
  seconds. Focused source-package module: direct exit 0, 135 passed, 13 warnings
  in 193.89 seconds.
- `git diff c36f3fc8..HEAD -- db/data` is empty: no tracked source manifest was
  modified.

### Deliberate boundaries

- Did not add crash-atomic multi-file transactions for an unexpected write or
  process failure midway through a coordinated revision. Every deterministic
  refusal is preflighted before writes/uploads and the successful path updates
  all owners; true cross-file crash atomicity needs a separate staging/rollback
  design and is not one of the eight findings.
- Did not port #227's `iter_directory_entries`: its exact implementation depends
  on #227's microdata list-entry machinery, which this slice explicitly
  excludes. Also retained the current artifact-local `bare_filename` exception
  wrapper so filename refusals remain `SourceArtifactManifestError` and the
  existing CLI reports them cleanly; #227's later rebase can adopt its broader
  exception hierarchy together.
- Did not add a new rule for two physical artifact files whose names normalize
  to the same key when the exact requested spelling sorts first. That is
  defense-in-depth outside findings 3/4; there are no such collisions in the
  tracked tree. Manifest-name collisions are already refused independent of
  sort order.

## Peer round 4 (nine findings)

### State

- Started from detached HEAD `fa98993a` with a clean worktree; no branches,
  pushes, stashes, GitHub access, or tracked `db/data/**` changes are authorized.
- Scope: the nine supplied provenance, publication preflight, canonical
  identity, manifest-vintage, filename, and regular-file findings.
- Preserve the shared helper names used by stacked PR #227; its worktree is
  read-only and will not be modified.
- Report path: `/tmp/chronicle-226-round4/out.md` (no explicit runner `-o`
  path was provided in the visible request).

### Done

- Read the existing journal, storage architecture, role rules, and named code
  surfaces. Began reviewing the named test modules and shared registration
  helpers. GitNexus debugging guidance is available, but no graph tools are
  exposed; use repository search and hermetic regression tests.
- Established this committed state/done/next journal before implementation.

### Next

- Add and run failing regressions for each finding before its implementation.
- Fix and commit coherent steps, recording exact red commands and observations
  in the external report.
- Run full Ruff lint, formatting checks for changed Python files, and the full
  pytest suite with direct exit codes; record counts and final commit map.

### Round 4 reproduction checkpoint

- Added publication/tree/identity/alias/sibling regression coverage in
  `tests/test_chronicle_artifact_peer4.py` before any associated fix.
- Red command: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/chronicle-uv-cache uv run pytest -q -p
  no:cacheprovider tests/test_chronicle_artifact_peer4.py` (stdout/stderr saved
  to `/tmp/chronicle-226-round4/main-red.log`) exited 1: 60 failed, 12 warnings.
- Finding 3: all 4 non-regular tree cases reached build-ID inference before
  refusal. Finding 4: all 24 invalid publication identity cases reached an
  artifact read or build-ID inference. Finding 5: all 10 noncanonical manifest
  declarations reached the publisher read. Finding 6: all 4 single case/Unicode
  aliases reached artifact reads. Finding 8: 12 explicit-selector sibling cases escaped as plain
  `ValueError` through the functions and harness; 6 top-level CLI tests had
  an invocation error (corrected and verified below).
- Consumer guard, source resolver, and shared vintage regressions are being
  developed independently; all implementations remain gated on observed red.

### Finding 2: source provenance reader

- Reproduced malformed/contradictory/non-R2 locators and checksum/filename
  mismatches with 10 failures and 1 passing control before implementation;
  exact command and output are in the external report's source evidence.
- `SourceArtifactSpec` now reuses `_validated_recorded_r2`, checks the manifest
  identity, and uses the immutable object's digest to validate local/fetched
  bytes even without a separately declared checksum. Invalid metadata is
  refused before artifact/cache I/O; bad fetched bytes before cache writes.
- The same focused command now exits 0: 11 passed, 12 warnings. Inventory's
  half of finding 2 remains next; no source package or source data was changed.

### Finding 5: exact manifest declarations

- Present `source_id` and `package_id` now pass `_require_identity_segment`
  without stripping or stringification and must equal the fetch argument.
  Absent fields remain eligible for first registration; null/empty fields do
  not impersonate absence.
- Focused regressions and existing other-package refusal controls passed:
  direct exit 0, 12 passed. The red checkpoint above recorded all 10 new
  declaration cases reaching publisher I/O before this fix.

### Finding 7: shared logical vintage validation

- Before implementation, the new manifest-vintage tests exited 1: 5 failed,
  1 passed. Duplicate keys `2024` and `"2024"` reached artifact I/O through
  publish, inventory, source loading, and fetch of another selected vintage.
- `load_manifest_document` now invokes shared `validate_manifest_vintages`
  over the entire manifest, so every consumer refuses a logical duplicate
  through its existing controlled YAML error path. Shared names are unchanged.
- Six regressions plus existing quoted-year compatibility tests exit 0:
  8 passed, 12 warnings. Scoped Ruff lint/format checks both pass.

### Finding 1: configured derived provenance

- Consumer guard regressions ran red before implementation: direct exit 1,
  35 failed and 1 passed; configured bucket/prefix provenance did not produce
  `derived_fact_provenance`. Exact evidence is in the external report.
- The guard resolves derived bucket/prefix configuration lazily, retains exact
  archived routes, and checks raw locator fields, source-file locators, and
  source URL. Added `default_r2_derived_prefix` with the standard environment
  lookup ladder so publication and the guard can share it.
- Full consumer-contract module passes: direct exit 0, 95 passed, 32 warnings;
  scoped Ruff checks pass. Wiring configured prefixes into publication and
  refusing unrecognizable explicit routes remains a publication follow-up.

### Finding 9: regular source resources

- Directory and FIFO manifest/artifact regressions ran red: direct exit 1,
  4 failed, 2 passed. The resolver returned non-regular manifests and reached
  artifact-read sentinels; no test opened a FIFO.
- The source resolver now requires an existing selected entry to be a regular
  file after symlink and spelling checks. Missing artifact entries still use
  the existing checksum-validated cache/fetch path; zip-backed resources work.
- Same focused command exits 0: 6 passed, 12 warnings. The full source-package
  module is running. Exact red/green commands are in the external evidence.

### Finding 8: controlled sibling-manifest refusals

- `_package_manifests` now translates discovery's `ValueError` into
  `MalformedManifestError`, so publish/inventory and both CLI entry points
  use the shared controlled refusal path even with an explicit selector.
- The first post-fix command actually exited 1: 12 passed and 6 top-level
  CLI cases failed because the test passed argv to a zero-argument entry point.
  Corrected the test to set sys.argv and assert SystemExit. The corrected
  command exits 0: 18 passed, 12 warnings; no uploads or rewrites occur.
  The earlier premature passing-count journal entry is corrected here.

### Additional round 4 red checkpoint

- Added inventory locator/identity regressions, explicit raw identity overrides,
  root/nested/excluded-registry derived symlinks, and derived prefix publication
  integration before fixing those paths. Focused `additional-red.log` command
  exited 1: 24 failed, 1 passed, 60 deselected, 14 warnings.
- Finding 2 inventory: six malformed/contradictory identity cases reached
  artifact reads; absent separate checksum allowed wrong local bytes as a valid
  R2 link. Valid URI-only locator control passed.
- Finding 3 additional tree cases reached upload or silently skipped the link.
  Finding 4 explicit overrides reached reads. Finding 1 both-custom explicit
  route reached inference; all three prefix environment names were ignored by
  publication. Exact command and observations are in the external report.
- Full source-package module completed: direct exit 0, 157 passed, 13 warnings
  in 192.07 seconds, including both source-reader fixes.

### Finding 3: complete derived tree preflight

- Derived publication now walks the root and every descendant with `lstat`,
  allowing only directories and regular files. It refuses symlinks/FIFOs,
  including an excluded registry filename, before build-ID inference, file
  reads, uploads, or registry writes.
- Both failing-first tree groups now pass: direct exit 0, 7 passed,
  78 deselected, 12 warnings. Safe nested directories remain publishable.

### Finding 6: exact physical artifact spelling

- Publish and inventory now turn a single normalized alias with different
  physical spelling into `artifact_spelling_mismatch`, and neither reads
  bytes after alias errors. Duplicate-alias refusal also stops before reads.
- Case/Unicode regressions plus duplicate/symlink controls exit 0: 6 passed,
  12 warnings. Missing filenames retain their separate missing-name error.

### Finding 4: canonical identities on new publication paths

- Derived publication validates source/package identifiers before inference or
  artifact reads. Raw publication preserves original argument/declaration types
  until new-key validation, rejects noncanonical identifiers and contradictory
  declarations before reading artifacts, and retains root-wide preflight.
- Identity regressions plus declaration controls exit 0: 44 passed,
  41 deselected, 12 warnings. Six historical-identity controls and the full
  tracked-registry cutover test also pass: 7 passed, 12 warnings. Recorded
  objects keep their original routes even when old manifests omit package_id.

### Finding 2: inventory provenance

- Inventory now reuses `_validated_recorded_r2` before artifact reads, rejects
  contradictory/incomplete/non-R2 locators and mismatched checksum/filename
  declarations, and checks actual bytes against the recorded digest even when
  a separate checksum is absent. Invalid entries expose no R2 link.
- Seven failing-first defect cases plus the valid URI-only control now pass:
  direct exit 0, 8 passed, 83 deselected, 12 warnings. Together with `d5e9952`,
  both consumers named in finding 2 now enforce immutable provenance.

### Finding 1: publication route enforcement

- Publication and the consumer guard now share `is_derived_r2_route` and the
  lazy prefix resolver. Derived key generation honors all three environment
  spellings for the configured prefix.
- A both-custom explicit bucket/prefix combination must identify a configured
  or archived derived route, otherwise publication refuses it before build
  reads. The storage architecture documents the shared route configuration.
- Four failing-first route integration cases now pass: direct exit 0,
  4 passed, 87 deselected, 16 warnings. All nine findings are implemented;
  focused integration verification and full final checks remain.

### Final review follow-ups

- Focused integration passed: direct exit 0, 409 passed, 40 warnings in 15.10s.
  Ruff lint passed and all 8 changed Python files passed formatting checks.
- Interrupted the first full pytest run (direct exit 130) after peer review
  found that date/set YAML identity refusals could fail CLI JSON serialization.
  It is not a completed full-suite verification and will be restarted.
- Reproduced a remaining configured-route bypass with uppercase `R2://` in
  raw URI, source_file, or source URL: 3 failed, 3 lowercase controls passed.
  URI scheme matching is now case-insensitive. Full consumer module now passes:
  direct exit 0, 101 passed, 32 warnings; scoped Ruff checks pass.
- Additional failing-first checks cover date/set report serialization (8 failed),
  vintage namespace escapes and build-ID separators (8 failed), and fetch
  vintage namespace escapes. These publication fixes precede the full restart.

- Committed the publication follow-up regressions before their fixes. Red
  commands/logs: `report-identity-red.log` (8 failed),
  `namespace-followup-red.log` (8 failed, 99 deselected), and
  `fetch-vintage-red.log` (3 failed); all direct exits 1. CLI refusals hit
  non-JSON date/set values; malformed vintage/build segments reached reads or
  upload sentinels. Exact commands will be included in the final report.

- Raw publication now keeps original identity values for validation and uses
  separate string fields only in reports. Date/set refusals serialize cleanly
  through both CLIs; historical skips also retain serializable identity fields.
  The regression and history controls exit 0: 14 passed, 12 warnings.

- New publication vintage segments and derived build-ID segments now pass the
  same canonical segment validator, preventing API-provided slashes or '..'
  from moving an otherwise recognized route. Fetch applies the vintage check
  before publisher I/O; historical raw objects retain their existing routes.
  All 11 failing-first namespace cases pass (99 deselected, 12 warnings).

### Final verification in progress

- Final focused integration exits 0: 434 passed, 40 warnings in 11.11s.
- Final `uv run ruff check .` exits 0 (`All checks passed!`). Final
  `uv run ruff format --check` on the 8 changed Python files exits 0
  (`8 files already formatted`). Both use the permitted UV cache.
- `git diff --check fa98993a..HEAD` and the tracked `db/data` no-change check
  both exit 0. Worktree clean before this journal update.
- Restart the full suite at code commit `19d037f` with UV offline, offline
  OpenTimestamps client selection, and live Supabase credentials removed from
  the child environment. This keeps the required full run free of network.

### Final state, done, and next (peer round 4)

**State:** complete. All nine findings and the peer-review follow-ups are fixed
in small detached-HEAD commits. Final code commit: `19d037f`; the completed
full run included the subsequent journal commit `9fa6a1d`.

**Done:**

- Full `uv run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider` returned direct exit 0:
  **1,238 passed, 7 skipped, 42 warnings in 1,468.40s (24m 28s)**.
  The child environment used the permitted UV cache, `UV_OFFLINE=1`, an offline
  OpenTimestamps client command, and no live Supabase URL/service/secret keys.
  Exact invocation and output are in `/tmp/chronicle-226-round4/out.md` and
  `/tmp/chronicle-226-round4/full-pytest.log`.
- Final whole-repository Ruff lint exited 0. Formatting checks on every changed
  Python file exited 0: 8 files already formatted. Final focused integration
  also exited 0: 434 passed, 40 warnings.
- No tracked `db/data/**` changes, GitHub/network access, pushes, branches,
  stashes, or edits to PR #227's worktree. Shared helper names remain intact.
- The external report contains each finding's red command and observed failure,
  fix, regression names, and commit SHA, plus the final verification and
  deliberate boundaries. It records the corrected CLI-test invocation and the
  interrupted first full run without counting either as passing verification.

**Next:** none in this fix lane. No push or branch operation is authorized.
