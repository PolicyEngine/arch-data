"""Access classification and hash-only registration for Chronicle artifacts.

Chronicle registers every raw artifact its consumers build from and stores the
bytes of only those the publisher permits it to redistribute. Manifest fields
carry that split:

``kind``
    Manifest-level: ``publisher_table`` or ``microdata_release``. Every
    manifest created or modified after
    ``docs/adr-chronicle-raw-microdata-identity.md`` declares it. Manifests
    that predate the rule are read as publisher tables only while they match
    the frozen list in :mod:`chronicle.grandfathered_manifests`; any other
    kindless manifest is an error, never a publisher table by default.

``licence``
    The publisher's terms. For a public microdata release this is an
    identifier from the allowlist in :mod:`chronicle.licences`, and the entry
    also carries ``licence_evidence`` binding this artifact to that term.

``access``
    A closed class: ``public``, ``licensed``, or ``restricted``.

``hash_source`` and its attester
    Who asserts the checksum: ``chronicle_fetch`` (``attested_by: chronicle``,
    ``verified_at`` = fetch date), ``consumer_attested`` (``attested_by`` = the
    consumer, ``attestation_evidence``, ``verified_at``), or ``consumer_pin``
    (``attested_by`` = the consumer, ``pinned_from`` = repository, path and
    commit, no ``verified_at``).

``public`` artifacts keep the fetch/publish path: bytes are archived in the raw
R2 bucket under the content-addressed key
``raw/{source_id}/{package_id}/{year}/{sha256}/{filename}``. ``licensed`` and
``restricted`` artifacts are registered *hash-only*: the manifest records the
checksum, vintage, licence, access route and attestation, and no Chronicle
store ever holds the bytes. That key exists only for ``public`` artifacts.

A registration is identified by ``{source_id, package_id, year, sha256,
filename}``. Consumers reference a registration by exactly that tuple. The
filename is a bare name inside the package directory, compared case-folded,
and ``2023`` and ``'2023'`` are one vintage key.
